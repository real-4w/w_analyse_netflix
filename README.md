# w_analyse_netflix
Willem's attempt to analyse Netflix data in Python.
Inspired by https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-tutorial-analyze-personal-netflix-data/

Created a sample Jupyter notbook going over a reduced Netflix dataset.

To do:

1) Make a program that asks for the analyse input rather than hardcoded in cell. variable =input("Please enter part of the title :")
